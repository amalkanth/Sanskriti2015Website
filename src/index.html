                    <br/> Dancing was, is and will be the most exotic of all art forms that our race has developed. The sensuous sways of a perfectly sliced human figure are one of those pleasures any living being cannot resist.<br />
<br />
Sanskriti 2015 pays tribute to this divine art form through its biggest event, Choreography.<br />
<br />
A form of expression in its most dignified stature, dancing speaks a language right from the heart. The cultural heritage of Sanskriti is written in scores of these, so be there, and experience the enigma...<br />

Musical idols revolutionize the world and inspire people to dream and believe in themselves. There is an idol in everyone. <br />

	“Your politicians blame a media syndicate by claiming that exploiting the sense of negativity in an individual’s mindset is the sound foundation on which modern day news media is firmly basing its ideologies. Along with pointing out the pointlessness of your classes claims, I would also like to bring into your notice that there is a crowd waiting to hear the lame justification that you would give them for this undignified act of folly that you have publically disembarked. So Mr, answer me, where do politicians of today set the benchmark for level of decency and decorum?” And you thou it was easy being the man on TV. Well, we would like to see how you would react if you were the man in this poor man's shoe. Don’t worry though not a pointlessly irritating as the likes of modern news journalist, we too have a bunch of out of their mind kiddos, who will find immense pleasure in eating your head while your own stage.<br />

	“Your politicians blame a media syndicate by claiming that exploiting the sense of negativity in an individual’s mindset is the sound foundation on which modern day news media is firmly basing its ideologies. Along with pointing out the pointlessness of your classes claims, I would also like to bring into your notice that there is a crowd waiting to hear the lame justification that you would give them for this undignified act of folly that you have publically disembarked. So Mr, answer me, where do politicians of today set the benchmark for level of decency and decorum?” And you thou it was easy being the man on TV. Well, we would like to see how you would react if you were the man in this poor man's shoe. Don’t worry though not a pointlessly irritating as the likes of modern news journalist, we too have a bunch of out of their mind kiddos, who will find immense pleasure in eating your head while your own stage.<br />
